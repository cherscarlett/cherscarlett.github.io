        'I am a student studying physics, mathematics, astronomy, and earth sciences in Southern California. I have had internships at NASA-JPL, Caltech, and a position as a teaching assistant funded by the National Science Foundation at Earthscope Consortium. I also had my studies in computational plasma physics with the Computational Research Access Network funded by Bryn Mawr College and have received scholarships from the American Institute of Physics, the National Science Foundation, and other philanthropic organizations.',
        'My research interests include plasma physics (particularly the near-earth plasma environment and atmospheric plasmas, but also fusion energy generation and other technological applications); space, atmospheric, and climate physics; heliophysics; nuclear and particle astrophysics; the interstellar medium; magnetohydrodynamics; degenerate materials that generate a magnetic field (i.e., metallic hydrogen); magnetic mirrors; gravity; and applying seismological principles to other energetic phenomena. I am also interested personally in unusually dense celestial objects like black holes and neutron stars.',

        'I was born in Walla Walla, Washington. I grew up in Southern California and both Eastern and Western Washington. When I was six years old, we moved to Redmond, and spent the rest of my childhood and adolescence moving around the Eastside of the Seattle area, near Microsoft, where I was exposed to science and technology. I tinkered with electronics and computers, constructed science experiments, read encyclopedias and science fiction, played online video games, and taught myself to code.',
        'A promising youth ended in my dropping out of Juanita High School, where I was a running start dual-enrollment student, on Dance and Gymnastics teams, and an AP and Honors student. I had moved out my junior year after many tumulutuous years in my homelife and was struggling to make ends meet. My life had been hard and I had no support system. I became a single mother soon afterward and wondered if I could code for a job. As it turned out, I could.'

        'From 2006 through 2011, I programmed primarily as a freelancer and worked full-time jobs in food service, moving around the country. I tried to go to college several times: for biotechnology, meteorology, environmental science, web design, web development, photography, and architecture. I had gotten high SAT scores and was accepted into every school I applied to, but nothing was sticking. Finally, I enrolled at the University of Missouri in St. Louis and declared an Astrophysics major. I was hooked. I tried desperately to make it work, but attended only a handful of classes before I stopped attending altogether. I loved it, but working two and three minimum wage jobs and taking care of a toddler left no room for my education. I scored a 99 on the ASVAB and seriously considered joining the Air Force for the financial stability.',
        'I was barely surviving and facing eviction when a USA Today Digital Products recruiter reached out in the fall of 2011. Weeks later my life changed completely and my daughter and I moved to Northern Virginia, near DC, and my successful software career began.',
        'From 2011 to 2023, I worked as a software engineer for big companies like Activision Blizzard, Starbucks, and Apple, and a few startups here and there. I spoke at conferences, contributed to open source software development, and mentored other women in tech. I became a fierce advocate for change and championed internal change and even legislation that protected workers and fostered equitible, inclusive policies and fair pay. In 2023, I worked with the ACLU of Washinton to strengthen the state\'s protections of health-related data extrapolated from AI algorithms to be in line with HIPAA protections. I used my Twitter platform to hold corporations and powerful people in technology accountable for the ways women are devalued and pushed out of the industry.',
        'In 2023, I began freelancing as I was pushed out of the industry after holding Apple accountable with the federal government in public. By becoming a whistleblower, I changed many laws in Washington state and assisted with a federal law. I got a literary agent and an offer for a book deal to write my memoir. But I was hiding something and couldn\'t write my way around it. I fled life-threatening domestic violence and graduated from the Personal Empowerment Program in 2023.'

    //    'I was exposed to abuse from a very young age, both as a witness and a victim. Most of my romantic relationships were toxic and surrounded by drugs, and when they weren\'t, I ran from them, more scared of the unfamiliarity of normal than what I knew of varying types of emotional, sexual, and physical abuse.',
    //    'In 2020, I married a man I had known since I was ten. To my knowledge, he had never objectified me and we had gone through our traumatic childhoods together. I knew how the justice system had set him and his family up for failure and marriage gave me the power to help him seek restorative justice for a childhood full of drugs, abuse, and repeated failures of social and carceral systems that instutionalized him as a juvenile. The same system that repeatedly forced me back into an abusive home by threatening me with detention as a runaway.',
    //    'The weekend we got married, he became a different person. I became his property. The possessive behavior wasn\'t foreign to me. My ex treated me identically and I took it as a sign that I was desirable and special. My ex, though, was cold and cruel with silence, infidelity, and lies. My ex made me feel worthless because he was using me and liked having me around when he was drunk or lonely. My husband made me feel worthless because he told me I was. The verbal abuse escalated into property violence quickly. The possessive behavior into stalking. I was afraid to do or say anything. It reminded me of my childhood, tiptoeing on eggshells around the adults, trying not to do or say the wrong thing to upset them into violence.',
    //    'In 2021, his abuse escalated into physical violence directed at me, mostly with throwing things at me or pushing me or tackling me to the ground. I told him I wanted a divorce, moved, and refused to tell him where I lived. He pushed his way back in. A few months later, when I was being cyberstalked and harassed by another activist, she drug his dramatic childhood into it and defamed him, misrepresenting his past for the purpose of hurting me. He strangled me for the first time and left.',
    //    'Over the next two years, I was locked in rooms or otherwise restrained against my will, pushed, tackled, hit, and strangled many times. The verbal abuse left me with little will to live. I see-sawed between desperately trying to make him happy and plotting my escape. I was struggling financially because the tech industry had suddenly become allergic to labor activists, and my mental health was deteriorating. After an altercation with him left me with a black eye and bruises all over my face, I took my daughter and got a hotel. We moved locations multiple times. He found me every time and let me know there was nowhere I could hide. I tried to get an apartment nearby, but I kept being flagged as high risk for my transient youth in poverty.',
    //    'In early 2023, I rented a house from a friend of a friend at the top of my budget, but I was free and safe. Until my bank gave him my new address, and when he showed up, I called 911 and the police told him I had called him, gave him the number I called them from, and told me "my husband was locked out," all without asking him for identification or proof he knew me at all in the middle of the night. This was the last in  a long line of calls I had made to the police, all of which resulted in more harm to me than less.',
    //    'In the summer of 2023, I decided I needed to get a degree of my career was ever going to overcome my labor activism. I pulled myself together, enrolled in school, and was accepted into a software development freelancing network. My husband spiraled out of control, feeling threatened by my motivation to turn my life back around. Days before my daughter was supposed to come back home from her summer with her dad, I experienced the most terrifying weekend of my life and was hospitalized twice. The police came to the hospital and for the first time, they actually arrested him. I fled the state and have not been back since. The charges were dropped when I refused to return out of fear to testify against him. I entered domestic violence counseling and withdrew from my classes to focus on stablizing.',
